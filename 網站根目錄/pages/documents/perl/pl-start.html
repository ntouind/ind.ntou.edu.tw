<title>PERL -- Starting a Perl Script</title>
<H3>Starting a Perl Script</H3>
Upon startup,
<I>perl</I>
looks for your script in one of the following places:
<OL>
<LI>Specified line by line via
<B>-e</B>
switches on the command line.

<LI>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
(Note that systems supporting the #! notation invoke interpreters this way.)

<LI>Passed in implicitly via standard input.
This only works if there are no filename arguments -- to pass
arguments to a
<I>stdin</I>
script you must explicitly specify a - for the script name.
</OL>
<P>
After locating your script,
<I>perl</I>
compiles it to an internal form.
If the script is syntactically correct, it is executed.
