<title>PERL -- Simple statements</title>
<H3>Simple statements</H3>
The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for its side
effects.
Every simple statement must be terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the
final statement in a block, in which case the semicolon is optional.
(Semicolon is still encouraged there if the block takes up more than one line).
<P>
Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a
single modifier, just before the terminating semicolon.
The possible modifiers are:
<pre>
	<A HREF=pl-compound.html#if>if</A> EXPR
	unless EXPR
	<A HREF=pl-compound.html#while>while</A> EXPR
	until EXPR
</pre>
The
<I>if</I>
and
<I>unless</I>
modifiers have the expected semantics.
The
<I>while</I>
and
<I>until</I>
modifiers also have the expected semantics (conditional evaluated first),
except when applied to a do-BLOCK or a do-SUBROUTINE command,
in which case the block executes once before the conditional is evaluated.
This is so that you can write loops like:
<pre>
	<A HREF=pl-exp-flow.html#do>do</A> {
		<A HREF=pl-predef.html#$_>$_</A> = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
		...
	} until <A HREF=pl-predef.html#$_>$_</A> <A HREF=pl-exp-op.html#eq>eq</A> ".\n";
</pre>
(See the
<I>do</I>
operator below.  Note also that the loop control commands described later will
NOT work in this construct, since modifiers don't take loop labels.
Sorry.)
