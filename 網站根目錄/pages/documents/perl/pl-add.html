<title>PERL -- ERRATA AND ADDENDA</title>
<h2>ERRATA AND ADDENDA</h2>
The Perl book,
<I>Programming Perl ,</I>
has the following omissions and goofs.
<P>
On page 5, the examples which read
<pre>
	eval "/usr/bin/perl
</pre>
should read
<pre>
	eval "exec /usr/bin/perl
</pre>
<P>
On page 195, the equivalent to the System V sum program only works for
very small files.  To do larger files, use
<pre>
	<A HREF=pl-exp-misc.html#undef>undef</A> $/;
	$checksum = <A HREF=pl-exp-conv.html#unpack>unpack</A>("%32C*",&lt;&gt;) % 32767;
</pre>
<P>
The descriptions of <A HREF=pl-exp-sys.html#alarm>alarm</A> and <A HREF=pl-exp-sys.html#sleep>sleep</A> refer to signal SIGALARM.  These
should refer to SIGALRM.
<P>
The
<B>-0</B>
switch to set the initial value of <A HREF=pl-predef.html#$/>$/</A> was added to Perl after the book
went to press.
<P>
The
<B>-l</B>
switch now does automatic line ending processing.
<P>
The qx// construct is now a synonym for backticks.
<P>
<A HREF=pl-predef.html#$0>$0</A> may now be assigned to set the argument displayed by
<I>ps (1).</I>
<P>
The new @###.## format was omitted accidentally from the description
on formats.
<P>
It wasn't known at press time that s///ee caused multiple evaluations of
the replacement expression.  This is to be construed as a feature.
<P>
(LIST) x $count now does array replication.
<P>
There is now no limit on the number of parentheses in a regular expression.
<P>
In double-quote context, more escapes are supported: \e, \a, \x1b, \c[,
\l, \L, \u, \U, \E.  The latter five control up/lower case translation.
<P>
The
<B>$/</B>
variable may now be set to a multi-character delimiter.
<P>
There is now a g modifier on ordinary pattern matching that causes it
to iterate through a string finding multiple matches.
<P>
All of the <A HREF=pl-predef.html#$^X>$^X</A> variables are new except for <A HREF=pl-predef.html#$^T>$^T</A>.
<P>
The default top-of-form format for FILEHANDLE is now FILEHANDLE_TOP rather
than top.
<P>
The <A HREF=pl-exp-str.html#eval>eval</A> {} and <A HREF=pl-exp-arr.html#sort>sort</A> {} constructs were added in version 4.018.
<P>
The v and V (little-endian) template options for <A HREF=pl-exp-conv.html#pack>pack</A> and <A HREF=pl-exp-conv.html#unpack>unpack</A> were
added in 4.019.
