<title>PERL -- BUGS</title>
<h2>BUGS</h2>
<P>
<I>Perl</I>
is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of various operations
such as type casting, atof() and sprintf().
<P>
If your stdio requires an seek or eof between reads and writes on a particular
stream, so does
<I>perl</I>.
(This doesn't apply to <A HREF=pl-exp-io.html#sysread>sysread</A>() and <A HREF=pl-exp-io.html#syswrite>syswrite</A>().)
<P>
While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary size limits (apart
from memory size), there are still a few arbitrary limits:
a given identifier may not be longer than 255 characters,
and no component of your PATH may be longer than 255 if you use -S.
A regular expression may not compile to more than 32767 bytes internally.
<P>
<I>Perl</I>
actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, but don't tell
anyone I said that.
