<title>PERL -- DIAGNOSTICS</title>
<h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the error, with an
indication of the next token or token type that was to be examined.
(In the case of a script passed to
<I>perl</I>
via
<B>-e</B>
switches, each
<B>-e</B>
is counted as one line.)
<P>
Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce error messages
such as "Insecure dependency".
See the section on <A HREF="pl-suid.html">setuid scripts</A>.
