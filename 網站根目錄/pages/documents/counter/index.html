  <LI> <A NAME="version"></A>
     <I> Where can I find the most recent version of the FAQ and the software ?</I><BR>
     Both the FAQ and counter software package can be found at
     <A HREF="http://sparkie.riv.net/software/counter/index.html">
     http://sparkie.riv.net/software/counter/index.html</A>
     <P>

  <LI> <A NAME="compilation"></A>
     <I> Compilation under which operating systems is possible ?</I><BR>
     Successful compilation under the following operating systems
     has been achieved:
     <UL>
       <LI> Linux 1.1.58 with cc and gcc 2.5.8
       <LI> SunOS 4.1.3 with gcc 2.6.3 (cc will not work)
       <LI> Solaris 2.4 with gcc 2.5.6
       <LI> IRIX 5.3 with cc and gcc 2.6.3
       <LI> HP-UX A.09.01 with cc and gcc 2.6.0
     </UL><P>

  <LI> <A NAME="server"></A>
     <I> Which WWW-server software is required ? </I><BR>
     The counter software should work with any WWW-server package
     which supports CGI-scripts like NCSA httpd, CERN httpd, Netsite, and 
     many more.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="error"></A>
    <I> Successful compilation but no image in my pages. What's wrong ?</I><BR>
    The two most common errors in this case:
    <UL>
      <LI> The read/write permissions on the <B>count_file</B> are wrong.<BR>
           The location of the count_file is specified in conf.h. The file which
           is specified there should be writable by the userid under which the 
           WWW-server is running. Most common is that the server is running under 
           the userid of <I>nobody</I>.
      <LI> The nph-count binary is installed in a directory where it's not possible
           to execute CGI-scripts. Check with the question on <A HREF="#cgi">
           CGI-directories</A> for more information.
    </UL><P>
    An on-line debugging tool is now incorporated with the counter software.
    If the counter binary is installed in a directory from which it is possible
    to execute CGI-scripts try the following by directly opening the URL:<BR>
    <B>http://localhost/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=dummy&debug=ON</B><BR>
    The returned HTML-page should provide additional information about possible
    sources of errors.<P>

    Error messages from the program are also logged to a location of your
    liking. Specify in the 'conf.h' where the messages should go.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="cgi"></A>
    <I> What should I specify as CGIBIN_DIR in the Makefile ?</I><BR>
    In most cases it is best to specify the global cgi-bin directory as 
    the place to install the binary. This system administrator usually only
    has access to this place.<BR>
    However, if you are a user on a system and you would like to install the 
    package in your local directory on the server, you have to make sure that 
    it is possible to execute CGI-scripts in user-directories on your server
    (in most cases this is disabled; check with your system administrator).
    If it is possible to do that, most probably the binary has to have the 
    extension .cgi. Just copy the resulting binary to nph-count.cgi.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="nph"></A>
    <I> Why does the resulting binary start with the 'nph-' ? </I><BR>
    Some WWW-server packages have problems when a CGI-script produces a GIF-picture
    as an output. The server parses the output of the CGI-script to determine what
    the header of the return message should be. To prevent the server from doing this
    you have to start the name of the CGI-script with 'nph' which stands for 
    <B>n</B>o <B>p</B>arse <B>h</B>eader.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="file_edit"></A>
    <I> Can I edit the 'count_file' with a normal text editor ? </I><BR>
    You shouldn't edit the 'count_file' yourself. In most cases, it 
    will become corrupt and all other counters in the file might be reset.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="upgrade"></A>
    <I> Do I need to do anything special when upgrading to the current version ?</I><BR>
    If you already have a previous version of the counter software running
    be carefull during installation of the current version. You will have to make
    sure that during the installation the nph-count binary is <B>not</B> called. 
    This can best be achieved by disabling the WWW-server for some time (try to
    minimize this as your server will not be accessible during that time).<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="arguments"></A>
    <I> Which arguments are accepted by the program ?</I><BR>
    The following arguments are currently recognized:
    <UL>
    <LI> <B>width</B>=<I>number</I><BR>
         Specifies the number of digits in the resulting image.
    <LI> <B>link</B>=<I>URL of the page on which the counter is located</I><BR>
         The link-argument is used to keep track of a certain counter.
         It should be unique for each counter. A good choice is the URL
         of the page on which the counter image is located.
    <LI> <B>increase</B>=<I>number; default 1</I><BR>
         Specifies the number by which the counter should be increased.
         This can be used to check how many times a certain page was visited
         without increasing the counter. In that case specify increase=0.<BR>
         Resetting a certain counter is also possible this way by specifying a negative
         number here.
    <LI> <B>show</B>=<I>NO</I><BR>
         In case you would like to keep track of the number of accesses to 
         a certain page without showing the counter image, specify the above
         argument.
    <LI> <B>debug</B>=<I>ON</I><BR>
         The above is a special argument which can used to check the correct
         working of the software. You should <B>NOT</B> specify this argument
         inside a HTML-page. Instead it should be used directly by calling 
         the nph-count program from the 'open URL' window, present in most 
         WWW-browsers, using something like the following:<BR>
         <B>http://localhost/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=dummy&debug=ON</B><BR>
         This will return an on-line generated HTML-page giving information
         about possible problems with the installed counter software.
    </UL><P>

  <LI> <A NAME="HTML-code"></A>
       <I>What to add in a HTML-page ?</I><BR>
       To activate a counter in a certain HTML-page add something like the 
       following:<BR>
       <B>&#60 IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/nph-count?arg1=value1&arg2=value2&arg3=value3"&#62 </B><BR>
       where <I>arg1,2,3</I> are any of the <A HREF="#arguments">supported arguments</A>.<BR>
       <B>NOTE:</B> do not specify the <B>debug</B> argument inside a HTML-page.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="invisible"></A>
       <I>How to keep track of a page without anybody knowing ? </I><BR>
       In the page you would like to monitor insert something like 
       the following:<BR>
       <B>&#60 IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=link_arg&show=NO"&#62 </B><BR>
       and on a different HTML-page where you would like the check the counter
       regularly:<BR>
       <B>&#60 IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=link_arg&increase=0"&#62 </B><BR>
       <P>

  <LI> <A NAME="reset"></A>
       <I>How to reset a certain counter to zero ? </I><BR>
       If you would like to reset a counter to zero, check the counter value
       and the link argument you used in a HTML-page and open the following
       URL directly (i.e. by typing it in, in the 'open URL' box):<BR>
       <B>http://localhost/cgi-bin/nph-count?link=link_arg&increase=-value</B><BR>
       This will reset the counter to zero (note: the counter value can not
       go negative).<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="outside_access"></A>
       <I>Can people from the rest of the Internet (ab)use the counter ?</I><BR>
       The current version of the counter program doesn't have access control
       incorporated yet. This means that anyone could maintain a counter 
       on your machine. However, this imposes no security problem for your machine.
       The next version of the package will have a possibility to restrict who
       is allowed to start a counter on your server.<P>

  <LI> <A NAME="size"></A>
       <I>What's the size of the resulting output image ?</I><BR>
       The program will return a GIF-image of 20 pixels high and 
       15 * <B>width</B> pixels wide. This can used to your advantage
       by specifying the HEIGHT and WIDTH inside the HTML-page. By doing
       this, during retrieval of the page, the WWW-browser can allocate
       space for the image while displaying the remainder of the page.<BR>
       Example:<BR>
       <B>&#60 IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/nph-count?width=5&link=dummy" WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=20&#62</B><BR>
       <P>
